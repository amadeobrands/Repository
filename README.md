Equation is a democratic investment corporation established on the Ethereum Blockchain, with the objective of allocating investor capital into avenues yielding a positive return on investment. Prior to founding Equation, [Him Gajria](www.himgajria.com) (him.eth) established an on-chain fund to experiment with a similar structure, calling it '[Radical](www.rdcl.xyz)'. This experiment lasted a year, turning $70,000 USD into $1,500,000 USD, returning 18x on investor capital (adjusted for subscriptions and redemptions).

## Current Thesis

Title: `Investing in a Paradigm Shift`

Proposed by: `0xFCFB33c0F77F4413af501dF32f4AE1dFd923069A`

With the introduction of the paper titled “Bitcoin: a peer-to-peer cash system”, a pseudonymous entity going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto, solved a problem that computer scientists and economists have been trying to solve for decades. A problem titled the “Byzantine Generals Problem”, which analogises Trust. This problem has entailed all of human cooperation, which is why applications on the internet were limited. Even within this limitation, the internet flourished, encompassing the entire planet with applications solving trillion dollar problems. Now for the first time ever, previous impossibilities have opened up in relation to every application and use-case entailing trust. This leads us into a new paradigm, which most layman are blind to or pessimistic about due to the current perception of the industry.
As speculation in digital assets peaked with all the hype created around blockchain technoology in 2017, scams became prominent, taking advantage of the newly borne gold rush. Since most assets within the industry were overpriced, due to a lack of any intrinsic value created in that same period resulted in the negative perception of cryptocurrencies and blockchain in general. This was a result of most headlines linking the technology to one scam or another. This does not come as a surprise to those who have witnessed paradigm shifts, as in their early days any paradigm attracts its own set of scammers due to the inflow of new capital.

All this attention led to a boom in interest from developers, scientists and researchers, with hordes of talent coming into the space to build problem solving products. These developments are dis-intermediating or completely replacing functions performed, products offered, and services rendered by existing companies and industries, let alone build new products that would not have been possible without the technology. Every time an innovation enables the disintermediation of existing industries and traditional ways of doing things, it’s considered a paradigm shift. A few notable paradigm shifts were Electrification, the Telephone, the Personal Computer, the Internet, the Smartphone, and now the Blockchain. And managing to catch a paradigm shift while it’s happening has historically proven to be extremely profitable. Entire funds have been built on the shifting of paradigms: Sequoia Capital and Accel Partners for Personal Computers, Andreeson Horowitz for the Internet, and Pantera Capital for Digital Assets.
